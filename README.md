## ðŸ‘€ Overview
This repository contains code for our paper DEMO: Reframing Dialogue Interaction with Fine-grained Element Modeling. We systematically construct the dialogue framework from the *Prelude* through the *Interlocution* to the *Epilogue* and define an innovative research task: **D**ialogue **E**lement **MO**deling. Furthermore, we introduce a tailor-designed benchmark **DEMO** to facilitate comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. Concretely, our proposed task focuses on two core competencies of models: (1) **Element Awareness**, which entails reverse engineering to decompose dialogue elements, and (2) **Dialogue Agent Interaction**, which involves goal-directed multi-turn dialogue modeling driven by elements. We meticulously design a data synthesis framework, contributing to a novel benchmark for dialogue modeling that encompasses multifaceted elements applicable to both English and Chinese. Besides, inspired by imitation learning, we amass a substantial collection of expert experiences and build a DEMO agent endowed with dialogue element modeling.

## ðŸ”¥ Update

- [xx/xx]ðŸ”¥DEMO is coming! We release the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/xxx), [code](https://github.com/MozerWang/DEMO), [models](https://huggingface.co/models/), and [data](https://huggingface.co/datasets) for dialogue elment modeling!
